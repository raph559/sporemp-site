# SporeMP — project website

Live website: https://raph559.github.io/sporemp-site/

A bilingual static website, with English as the default and French available through the EN / FR selector. It has no npm dependencies, visitor accounts or trackers. This repository contains the website and its original illustration, without game files or private development data.

## Publish news and development updates

Edit `content.json` for English content and `locales/fr/content.json` for its French translation, then commit both files to `main`. GitHub Actions builds the website and publishes it through GitHub Pages. Each article must use the same English slug in both languages. The build refuses to publish mismatched article sets.

- `news`: add an article with a unique lowercase, hyphenated English `slug`, an ISO `YYYY-MM-DD` date, a category, a title, a summary and paragraphs. Articles are sorted newest first.
- `releases`: add new versions at the beginning of the list, including their changes and limitations.
- `roadmap`: update future goals and their status. Do not present planned work as available functionality.
- `site.config.json`: stores the website URL and the shared `leetchiUrl`. Replace `null` with the exact HTTPS fundraiser URL to show the donation button in both languages. Until it is configured, the site displays a fundraiser-pending message.

Current content reflects the recorded M09 persistence and M10 location foundations completed by September 26, 2026, with Creature gameplay coverage next. The listed launcher versions are development builds through 0.1.13. The site does not announce a public multiplayer download, and development news can be ahead of the reviewed public mod source export.

## Repository language and translations

English is the repository's working language: documentation, code comments, workflow labels, identifiers and new article paths must be written in English. French visitor-facing text belongs under `locales/fr/`.

- `content.json`: default English articles, release notes and roadmap.
- `i18n.mjs`: English interface copy and locale registration.
- `locales/fr/content.json`: French content translations.
- `locales/fr/ui.json`: French interface translations, including the native language name.
- `legacy-routes.json`: compatibility redirects for already-published article URLs. Historical French URL strings are retained only so existing links keep working.
- `legacy-anchors.json`: compatibility aliases for previously shared section links.

English pages are published at the root and French pages under `/fr/`. Both use English article paths under `news/`. Language links preserve article identity and section anchors.

## Local development

With Node.js 22 or later:

```sh
node build.mjs
node check.mjs
python -m http.server 4173 --directory dist
```

Open http://localhost:4173. `build.mjs` escapes content and generates HTML pages, metadata, redirects and a sitemap in `dist/`. Articles remain readable without JavaScript. `check.mjs` validates files, local references, language metadata and section anchors.

## Artwork

`assets/universe.png` is the original SporeMP launcher illustration, created with Image Gen on September 8, 2026. It is neither a gameplay screenshot nor an asset extracted from SPORE. SHA-256: `5397f78275521e8bb8f7f4344c79e58bf6d16cdb36b0a1f66a3c5de6e625b184`.

SporeMP is an independent community project, unaffiliated with Electronic Arts or Maxis. SPORE belongs to its respective rights holders.
